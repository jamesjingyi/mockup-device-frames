# Device Mockups

Apple is great and publishes device frames so you can use them for mockups. Unfortunately this isn't across the board, and most companies don’t make nice device frames, especially Android and Windows!

I’ve collected some of these for me to use, and will try and keep them up to date.

## Latest update - 15th Sept
- Added iPhone 15 Pro Max (All created by me!)

Provided is:

* The Sketch file with all the frames, including details of coordinates and resolutions
* PNG exports for your use

Credits for the images are as follows:
* iPhone 15 Pro Max - Me!
* iPhone 14 Pro Max - Meta Device Frames (https://design.facebook.com/toolsandresources/devices/)
* iPad Pro 12.9 and 11 - Meta Device Frames (https://design.facebook.com/toolsandresources/devices/)
* Google Pixel 8 Pro - Me! (Used a leaked image from The Verge)
* Google Pixel Tablet - Me!
* MacBook Pro 14 - Apple Developer Resources (https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/)
* iMac 24 - Meta Device Frames (https://design.facebook.com/toolsandresources/devices/)
* Dell XPS 13 Plus - Image taken from Dell’s website, and skewed and masked by me (https://www.dell.com/en-uk/shop/laptops/xps-13-plus-laptop/spd/xps-13-9320-laptop)
* Dell Ultrasharp 5K - Meta Device Frames (https://design.facebook.com/toolsandresources/devices/)

My to-do list:
* A Google Sheet with dimensions and aspect ratios
* A new Windows Desktop
* Maybe making all the devices myself?

If anyone wants me to remove anything as it doesn’t conform to licences please do let me know - I am distributing these for no gain of my own, but I understand if licences stop things.
