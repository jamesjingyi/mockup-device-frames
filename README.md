# Device Mockups

Apple is great and publishes device frames so you can use them for mockups. Unfortunately this isn't across the board, and most companies don’t make nice device frames, especially Android and Windows!

I’ve collected some of these for me to use, and will try and keep them up to date.

## Latest update - 4th Jul
- Added the Huawei MateView (4.5K)
- Added the new Surface Laptop 13 and 15
- Edited some coordinates of the Windows laptops so that all screenshots start at 400, 200
- In the Contents page added a size guide for real-world sizing, so you can easily mock up multiple devices next to each other

Provided is:

* The Sketch file with all the frames, including details of coordinates for screenshots, resolutions, and sizing guides
* PNG exports for your use

* Pro Display XDR - I found this file and can't find the original, but I made quite a few edits, but still it's not just my work!
* Studio Display - I edited the Pro Display XDR file, so half me, half someone else

My to-do list:
* A Google Sheet with dimensions and aspect ratios
* A new Windows Desktop
* Maybe making all the devices myself?

If anyone wants me to remove anything as it doesn’t conform to licences please do let me know - I am distributing these for no gain of my own, but I understand if licences stop things.
